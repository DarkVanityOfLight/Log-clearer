# Log-clearer

Linux only

This app will work with Shred, 
it will clear all logs located at /var/log.
After the clear there will be no known way to restore these logs.
And there will be a little suprise left over, have fun with it.


Usage:
python3 clearlogs.py

And thats it, no one will ask or know about your little actions ;)
